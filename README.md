#### A simple GUI tool for design of oligonucleotides for cloning into a vector for shRNA mediated gene knockdown
##### by Combiz Khozoie, Ph.D.

This tool was created for internal use within the laboratory to facilitate the design of oligonucleotides for shRNA gene knockdown.  The tool uses The RNA Consortium best practices for cloning into the AgeI/EcoRI restriction fragment of a pLKO1-stuffer vector.

The tool takes a 19-29bp stem sequence as input and returns two oligonucleotides ready for synthesis in the 5'->3' orientation.  After annealing these oligos include a 5'AgeI overhang (ccgg), a 3'EcoRI underhang (ttaa), a 6bp CTCGAG loop, and a RNA Pol III terminator sequence.
