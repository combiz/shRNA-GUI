#### A simple GUI tool for design of oligonucleotides for cloning into a polIII vector for shRNA mediated gene knockdown
##### by Combiz Khozoie, Ph.D.

This tool was created for internal use within the laboratory to facilitate the design of oligonucleotides for shRNA gene knockdown.  The tool uses The RNA Consortium best practices for cloning into a 5' AgeI overhang  and 3' EcoRI underhang on the pLKO1-stuffer vector.

The tool takes a 19-29bp stem sequence as input and returns two oligonucleotides ready to order in the 5'->3' orientation.
